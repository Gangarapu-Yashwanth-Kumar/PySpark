## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark (PySpark)** ‚Äî distributed computing engine
- **Python 3** ‚Äî programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äî for interactive code and documentation
- **Spark MLlib** ‚Äî built-in library for machine learning

---

## ‚ö° How to Run

To get started with running the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python

Make sure Python 3 is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

If not, download and install it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

---

### 2. Install Java (Required for Spark)

PySpark requires Java 8 or later. Verify with:

```bash
java -version
```

If not installed, download Java JDK from: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

---

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv pyspark-env
# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
pyspark-env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source pyspark-env/bin/activate
```


---

### 4. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyspark.git
cd pyspark
```
